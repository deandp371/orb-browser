# orb-browser
Minor planet orbit browser implemented in HTML and Javascript. The utility allows a user to input a file containing orbits in the IAU Minor Planet Center (MPC) and browse, filter and export the entries in the MPCORB or other formats.

The utility can be loaded into any current browser supporting Javascript, so no additional software is required. It is not currently practical to load the entire MPCORB database into the browser but published subsets such as the NEA elements (NEA.txt) can be loaded, browsed and filtered to explore the data or produce subsets of interest for obesrvation or other research.

The browser utility is available to try at TDB. Or you can download the HTML page and supporting libraries and run it locally on any workstation as all of the processing is (currently) performed client-side. The utility is available under an Open Source license, so you are free to
use and modify the utility in your own web sites or applications.
